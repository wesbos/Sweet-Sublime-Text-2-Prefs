A collection of Sublime Text 2 Snippets and Preferences. 

The two important files here are:

`Global.sublime-settings` and `mySnippets.sublime-snippet`

#### Things are pretty bare at the moment as I'm a new Sublime Text 2 user. Please add and share your favourite prefs/snippets

### To Use:
Clone the repo into the sublime text 2 user package folder
`git clone git://github.com/wesbos/Sweet-Sublime-Text-2-Prefs.git "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"`

When there is an update, simply naviate over to `"~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"` and type `git pull`

To add a preference or snippet, fork the repo and submit a pull request. If you want commit access, just ask after your first pull request.
